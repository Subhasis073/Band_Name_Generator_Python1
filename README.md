**Overview**
The Band Name Generator is a beginner-friendly Python application that takes two simple user inputs — the city you grew up in and the name of your pet — and combines them to suggest a fun, personalized band name.

This project represents one of my early hands-on explorations in Python programming, focusing on mastering the foundations of input handling, string manipulation, and user interaction in the console.

**Learning Objectives & Technical Implementation**

Through this project, I explored and practiced several core programming fundamentals in Python:

1. User Input Handling (input()) -	Learned how to collect dynamic user inputs from the command line for real-time interaction.
2. String Concatenation  -	Practiced combining and formatting string data to create meaningful output.
3. Basic Program Flow - Designed a simple logical sequence of steps (input → process → output).
4. Console Interaction	- Improved understanding of how command-line applications communicate with users.
5. Code Readability & Simplicity -	Focused on writing clear, self-explanatory code with minimal dependencies.

This foundation helps in building more advanced Python applications involving functions, file handling, and modular design later on.

**Example Interaction**

Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
What's the name of the city you grew up in?
> Delhi
What's your pet's name?
> Coco
Your Band Name could be: Delhi Coco
